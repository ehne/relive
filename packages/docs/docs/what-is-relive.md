# What is Relive?

Relive is a broadcast graphics system that uses React. It allows you to write complex and reactive animations for live broadcast settings like live-streaming and television production. Relive provides one hook that is used to get the current frame of animation and any data that is present on the control panel. The control panel is the way to interact with your Relive animations, controlling as many animations as you want from the one screen. Because Relive runs on React, it can create high-quality graphics anywhere an HTML window can be opened. 

## Goals
* Have an insanely high uptime with nearly no frames dropped.
* Almost zero delay between data being sent and showing up on the animation
* Be extremely easy to get up and running with. (Have a look at the "quickstart" guide).
* Support broadcasts of any size.
* Make character generation (the industry term for broadcast graphics) more accessible.
