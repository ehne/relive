Handles rendering the remote UI. IE. the `/ui/remote` route

The style variables were generated with [hihayk's shaper tool](https://hihayk.github.io/shaper/#system-ui,%20sans-serif/1.23/0.9/2.37/0.8/1.65/0.5/0/100/50/5/0/1/false). The CSS reset is [minireset by jgthms](https://jgthms.com/minireset.css/), used under the MIT License. 

The styles are stored in `src/styles.js` and the CSS-in-JS is powered by [goober by Cristian Bote](https://goober.js.org), used under the MIT License.

`mount.jsx` just deals with loading the code for the parcel test server, it isn't actually used by packaged Relive.
