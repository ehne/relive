# Relive

![relive logo](./design-assets/relive-card.png)

A live animation system, powered by React.


## Goals
* Work 95% of the time.
* Be extremely easy to set up.
* Require a maximum of one (1) js file for it to work on your end.
* Ideally it should just be: `npx relive index.jsx`
* Have the delay between starting an animation on the remote and it playing in the viewer be fast enough that it's basically real time.
* All code should be easy to understand and well commented.
