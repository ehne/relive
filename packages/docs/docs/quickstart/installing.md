# Setup and Installation

## Prerequisites
Relive doesn't require anything other than a recent (â‰¥ v16.5.0) version of Node.js. If you don't have Node.js installed, have a look at the [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) guide.

## Scaffold
The easiest way to get setup with Relive is to scaffold a Relive project. All you need to do is to run the following on your terminal.

```bash
npm i
```
